> **"Data is the foundation of education management."**
> 
> *ScholasticOS* is a full-stack financial, administrative, and academic resource planning (ARP) platform designed to eliminate the complexity of running a modern educational institution. It is not just a CRUD application; it is a networked system of critical records (fees, exams, attendance, assets).

## ⚡️ Key Features & Engineering Highlights

### **1. 📊 Real-Time Institutional Analytics**
*   **Problem:** Traditional school software provides static, paginated lists.
*   **Solution:** Uses **Server-Client Component Composition** to render instant, aggregated data (Total Revenue, Daily Attendance, Grade Averages) without waterfall requests.
*   **Tech Stack:** `Next.js App Router (RSC)`, `Prisma Aggregate Queries`.

### **2. 💰 Financial Ledger Integrity**
*   **Problem:** Fee Management requires absolute precision (no duplicate receipts, correct partial payments).
*   **Solution:** Modeled around **Double-Entry Bookkeeping Principles**. Payments are immutable transaction records linked to `FeeStructures`.
*   **Result:** Audit-ready financial trails, supporting partial payments, due dates, and varying fee types (Tuition, Lab, Transport).

### **3. 🗓 Temporal Conflict Resolution**
*   **Problem:** Preventing teacher/room double-booking in timetables.
*   **Solution:** The data schema enforces unique constraints on `(Teacher, Day, TimeSlot)` and `(Room, Day, TimeSlot)` tuples.
*   **Result:** Impossible to schedule conflicting classes at the database level.

### **4. 🛡 Enterprise-Grade Security**
*   **Middleware-Protected Routes:** Custom `Next.js Middleware` intercepts all `/dashboard` and `/api` requests to ensure session validity at the edge.
*   **Zod Schema Validation:** Shared validation logic between Client Forms (`react-hook-form`) and Server Actions (`API Routes`) eliminates payload discrepancies.
*   **Type Safety:** End-to-end `TypeScript` integration ensures compile-time safety for all data mutations.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** `React 19`, `Next.js 15 (App Router)`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Framer Motion` (for micro-interactions).
*   **Backend:** `Next.js API Routes`, `Server Actions`.
*   **Database:** `SQLite` (Development), `PostgreSQL` (Production Ready), `Prisma ORM`.
*   **Validation:** `Zod`, `React Hook Form`.
*   **Design System:** Custom `shadcn/ui`-inspired component library with a focus on accessibility and dense information hierarchy.
