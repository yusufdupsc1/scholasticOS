Multi-tenant school operations platform for modern institutions.

scholaOps is a production-oriented fullstack application that manages academics, attendance, finance, users, and school communications in one system. The codebase is intentionally structured to demonstrate end-to-end engineering ownership: domain modeling, secure auth, operational readiness, and CI/CD automation.

## Why This Repository Is Strong

- Multi-tenant data model with institution-level isolation in Prisma.
- Fullstack architecture using Next.js App Router, Server Actions, API routes, and middleware.
- Role-aware access control with Auth.js v5 + JWT claims.
- Production guardrails: strict type checks, linting, build gating, Docker runtime, and CI pipeline.
- Security-first defaults: CSP, HSTS, permissions policy, input validation, and environment validation.

## Product Scope

- Institution management: organization profile, settings, plans.
- Academic operations: classes, subjects, timetable, grades, attendance.
- People and identity: admins, teachers, students, parents, staff.
- School operations: announcements, events, analytics.
- Finance and payments: fee tracking and Stripe checkout/webhook integration.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22`
- pnpm `10.x`
- PostgreSQL (local or cloud)

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yusufdupsc1/ScholaOps.git
cd ScholaOps
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:seed # optional
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

Source of truth: [.env.example](./.env.example)

Key required variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `AUTH_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

Optional integrations:

- `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `UPLOADTHING_SECRET`, `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`

## Quality Gates

```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm run type-check
pnpm run test
pnpm run test:e2e
pnpm run build
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (managed)

- CI workflow includes production deploy hooks via `pnpm dlx vercel`.
- Ensure secrets are configured in GitHub + Vercel environments.

### Docker (self-hosted)

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Uses a multi-stage Dockerfile with Next.js standalone output.
- Includes app, Postgres, Redis, and a migration job service.

Full runbook: [Deployment Guide](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Run Directly From Registry Image

Pull latest from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull yusufdupsc1/scholaops:latest
```

Pull latest from GHCR:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/yusufdupsc1/scholaops:latest
```

Run container:

```bash
docker run --name scholaops \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DB" \
  -e AUTH_SECRET="replace-with-32-plus-char-secret" \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000" \
  -d yusufdupsc1/scholaops:latest
```

## API Surface

Representative routes:

- `GET /api/health` (app + DB health)
- `GET /api/v1/students` (versioned REST API)
- `GET /api/v1/realtime/notifications` (SSE/polling notifications stream)
- `POST /api/auth/[...nextauth]` (Auth.js handlers)
- `GET/POST /api/uploadthing` (file uploads)
- `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` (payment webhooks)

Primary domain logic lives in:

- [`src/server/actions`](./src/server/actions)
